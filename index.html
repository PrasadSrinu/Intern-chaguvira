    <p>The revolutionary leader Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born on June 14, 1928, in Rosario, Argentina.
    After completing his medical studies at the University of Buenos Aires, Guevara became politically active
    first in his native Argentina and then in neighboring Bolivia and Guatemala. He became president of the 
    Cuban national bank and helped to shift the country's trade relations from the United States to the Soviet
    Union.Guevara addressed the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1964, where he also expressed
    support for the people of Puerto Rico. One year later, he was appointed minister of industry. Guevara left this post in 1965
    to export the ideas of Cuba's revolution to other parts of the world. In 1966, he began to try to incite the people
    of Bolivia to rebel against their government, but had little success.He served as chief of the Industrial Department
    of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, president of the National Bank of Cuba (famously demonstrating his
    disdain for capitalism by signing currency simply “Che”), and minister of industry. Guevara became a Cuban citizen, 
    as prominent in the newly established Marxist government as he had been in the revolutionary army, representing Cuba
    on many commercial missions. He also became well known in the West for his opposition to all forms of imperialism and
    neocolonialism and for his attacks on U.S. foreign policy.Guevara was captured and killed on October 9, 1967 in La
    Higuera by the Bolivian army.Since his death, Guevara has become a legendary political figure. His name is often equated
    with rebellion, revolution, and socialism. Others, however, have remembered that he could be ruthless and ordered prisoners
    executed without trial in Cuba. Guevara's life continues to be a subject of great public interest and been explored and
    portrayed in numerous books and films.</p>
